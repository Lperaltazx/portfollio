                <p>My name is Luis Peralta and I never knew that I wanted to be a web develiper until recently as you can tell my favorite prime color is red and darker shade is black.I am a person of many likes I like to watch anime another thing I like to do spend time with my shiba her names is snow. I am the least photogenic person you will ever meet,if you need anything to talk about aswell I am that person for I give good wisdom. My hobbies are singing, voice acting,Listening to music ad eating. I got into coding out of curiosity and aswell I was intersted in what my uncle job was like i found it very interesting because of how specific it has to be and I enjoyed practicing it on my own but I felt that I was missing something
                    and I needed guidence so I looked for diffrent programs and I found this one here.</p>
